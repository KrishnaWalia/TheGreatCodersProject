                <h1>Debunking 5 Common Diet Myths That Are Holding You Back</h1>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600">The world of nutrition is filled with misinformation. These common myths can lead to frustration, unhealthy habits, and ultimately, failure to reach your goals. Let's debunk five of the biggest offenders with science.</p>
                
                <img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/E0F2FE/334155?text=Truth+vs+Myth" alt="A scale balancing healthy food and a question mark" class="rounded-xl my-8 shadow-md">

                <h2>Myth 1: Carbs are the enemy and make you fat.</h2>
                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Carbohydrates are your body's primary source of energy. The issue isn't carbs themselves, but the type and quantity. Complex carbohydrates like those from vegetables, whole grains, and legumes provide sustained energy and essential nutrients. It's the overconsumption of simple, refined carbs (like sugary drinks and white bread) that can contribute to weight gain.</p>

                <h2>Myth 2: You must eat small, frequent meals to boost metabolism.</h2>
                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> While eating regularly can help manage hunger, research shows that for most people, meal frequency has little to no effect on overall metabolic rate. Total daily calorie and macronutrient intake are far more important than the timing or number of meals you eat.</p>
                
                <h2>Myth 3: A "detox" or "cleanse" is necessary to clean your system.</h2>
                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Your body already has a highly efficient detoxification system: your liver and kidneys. These organs work 24/7 to filter waste and toxins. So-called "detox teas" and juice cleanses are often just diuretics and provide no additional cleaning benefit. A balanced diet is the best way to support your body's natural processes.</p>
                
                <h2>Myth 4: Eating fat makes you fat.</h2>
                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Healthy fats are essential for hormone production, vitamin absorption, and brain health. Fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil are incredibly beneficial. The fats to limit are artificial trans fats and an overabundance of saturated fats found in processed foods.</p>
                
                <h2>Myth 5: You can out-exercise a bad diet.</h2>
                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> While exercise is crucial for health, it's very difficult to burn off the high number of calories found in a consistently poor diet. A sustainable, healthy physique is built on the foundation of good nutrition. You can't have one without the other for long-term success. Think of it as an 80/20 rule: 80% nutrition, 20% exercise.</p>
