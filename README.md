Aura Fit - Your Personal AI Wellness Ecosystem
Aura Fit is a modern, responsive frontend concept for a hyper-personalized wellness platform. Built with clean HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project demonstrates a user-centric approach to fitness, moving beyond generic plans to create an empathetic and intelligent experience.

Core Philosophy: Fitness isn't a punishment; it's a personal journey of discovery and strength. Our AI is not a drill sergeant; it's an intelligent wellness companion that adapts to your body, lifestyle, medical needs, and even your taste buds.

Community & About Us (community.html, about.html)

Jokes Page (jokes.html) for a fun user engagement feature.

Smooth Animations: Subtle scroll-based fade-in animations and hover effects to create a premium user experience.
